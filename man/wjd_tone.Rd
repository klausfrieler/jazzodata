\description{
Loudness (resp. intensity) related values for single tone events have been extracted from jazz solos by means of
sophisticated MIR techniques and are stored in the WJD
database, where five different values are available: Maximum, median and standard deviation of loudness,
relative position of loudness peak and temporal centroid. Here, only a meaningful subset is included.
See \url{https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/melospy/transformations.html} for further information.

This data frame contains the most important features and meta-data for tonal analysis. Specifically, it contains a local
scale degree annotation created with the corresponding functions from \code{parkR}-package.
This also means, it contain fewer solos (429) than the WJD (456 solos), as not all solo have annotated chords that allow such an harmonic
analysis
